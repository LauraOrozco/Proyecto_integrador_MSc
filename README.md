# Document classification with Machine Learning techniques in Python
The idea is to extract the text of each of the pdf documents that have been transformed into .txt files and capture the information within them by means of NLP (Natural Processing Language) and from this information train a classification model to determine which document corresponds to which topic under the framework of this project (Oils, Gases and Furans).
